    "##### ques 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "**Ans**:def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.<br>\n",
    "    Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement."

    "##### ques 2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "**Ans**:The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like regular functions declared with the def keyword. They can be used whenever function objects are required."

    "map(): The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence.<br>\n",
    "filter(): The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true.<br>\n",

    "**Ans**:Function annotations are completely optional both for parameters and return value. Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions at compile time.<br>\n",
    "nnotations of simple parameters def func(x: expression, y: expression = 20):\n",
